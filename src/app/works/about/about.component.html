            I am Vatsal Kandoi, a web developer and electronics engineer, passionate about building scalable applications, and aeroplanes.

            <br>
            Building web applications for the past two years has been a great experience for me, from thinking "why should I waste time in structuring my code" to "first I need to decide how to structure this application". I have written both, an API in a single file, and a properly structured API.
            <br>
            Being a part of an aviation team has taught me to use the most optimum component required for a task, while taking into consideration the weight, cost, and importance of the component. I guess working on a limited budget with little scope for error really makes you think before making a decision.
